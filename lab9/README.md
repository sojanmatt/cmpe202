**<h1>Design Pattern: Strategy pattern<h1>**  

<h3>To implement the Strategy pattern in the java 7 and previous versions, I would create an interface and hierarchy of classes that will implement the interface. In the sample code I have created a TotalStrategy interface and have implemented the interace to calculate the total sum of the list, even sum, and odd sum.  
Using Lambda, I have a library of functions instead of library of classes.Now I don't have to separate classes 
The advantage of using lambda is that the code becomes lightweight and more easy to read.<h3>
