# UMLGraph 

	Automated Drawing of UML Diagrams
	http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/
	
UMLGraph allows the declarative specification and drawing of UML class and sequence diagrams. The current features are part of an ongoing effort aiming to provide support for all types UML diagrams. 

An IEEE Software article titled [On the declarative specification of models](http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2003-IEEESW-umlgraph/html/article.html) explains the rationale behind this approach. The tehnology behind UMLGraph was used to draw many of the diagrams appearing in the award-winning books [Code Quality: The Open Source Perspective (Addison Wesley, 2006)](http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2003-IEEESW-umlgraph/html/article.html) and [Code Reading: The Open Source Perspective (Addison Wesley, 2003)](http://www.spinellis.gr/codereading). 

In addition, the UMLGraphDoc doclet included in this distribution automatically adds UML diagrams to javadoc documentation.

# UMLGraph Install Instructions

	http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/doc/install.html
	
	To install UmlGraph follow these steps.

    1. Copy the files in lib to a directory you will use for storing UmlGraph's installation (for instance, /usr/local/lib).
    2. Copy the file bin/umlgraph (for Unix) or bin/umlgraph.bat (for Windows) to a directory of your execution path (for instance, /usr/local/bin).
    3. Adjust the above file, setting UMLGRAPH_HOME to point to the directory where you installed the UmlGraph library files.

	UMLGraph is implemented as a javadoc doclet (a program satisfying the doclet API that specifies the content and format 
	of the output generated by the javadoc tool). Furthermore, the output of UmlGraph needs to be post-processed with the 
	Graphviz dot program. Therefore, to draw class diagrams with UmlGraph class you will need to have javadoc and Graphviz 
	installed on your computer. Both programs are freely available, from Sun and AT&T respectively, for many platforms 
	including Unix and Windows. Javadoc is part of the Sun JDK, so a typical JDK installation will also include javadoc.

	To draw UML sequence diagrams you must also install the free GNU plotutils system.
