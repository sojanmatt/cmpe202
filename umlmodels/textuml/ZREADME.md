# TextUML Toolkit

	http://abstratt.github.io/textuml/readme.html
	
TextUML Toolkit is an open-source IDE for UML that lets you create models at the same speed you write code. By adopting a textual notation, the TextUML Toolkit provides benefits you will not get elsewhere:

1. increased modeling productivity
2. compatible with any tools that support Eclipse UML2 models
3. the features you like in your favorite IDE: instant validation, syntax highlighting, outline view, textual comparison
4. live graphical visualization of your model as class diagrams
