	In this code we have attached a handler to the click event. This is fairly
	simple code but think about how rapidly the complexity of this code
	increases when we add conditions like "ignore additional click for 500ms
	once a click is fired to prevent people double-clicking" and "Fire a
	different event if the Ctrl key is being held when the button is clicked".
	Reactive programming or functional reactive programming provides a simple
	solution to these complex interaction scenarios through use of streams

	REF:  http://reactivex.io/

	Using RxJS you create an observable instead.

	var button = document.querySelector('button');
	Rx.Observable.fromEvent(button, 'click')
	  .subscribe(() => console.log('Clicked!'));

<!-- Let's start with a brief piece of HTML:  -->

<body>
  <button id="button"> Click Me!</button>
  <br/>
  <span id="output1"></span>
  <br/>
  <span id="output2"></span>  
</body>


<!-- To this, let's add a quick click counter -->

<script>

  var counter1 = 0;
  var button = document.getElementById('button');
  var source = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(button, 'click');
  var subscription = source.subscribe(function (e) {
    counter1++;
    output1.innerHTML = "Clicked " + counter1 + " time" + (counter1 > 1 ? "s" : "");
  });

</script>


<!--

	Here you can see we're creating a new stream of events from the click
	event on the button. The newly created stream is commonly referred to as a
	metastream. Whenever an event is emitted from the source stream it is
	automatically manipulated and published, as needed, to the metastream. We
	subscribe to this stream and increment a counter. If we wanted to react to
	only the even numbered events, we could do so by subscribing a second
	function to the stream:

-->

<script>

	var counter2 = 0;
	var incrementSubscription = source.subscribe(() => counter2++);
	var subscription = source.filter(x=>counter2%2==0).subscribe(function (e) {
	  output2.innerHTML = "Clicked " + counter2 + " time" +(counter2 > 1 ? "s" : "");
	});

</script>
