In the lab 1 the normal approach was to pass the machine type as the user input and the corresponding machine will be initiated . 
In Lab 10 we have a config file where we can pre define the machine to be initiated for the user. This paves way to future accommodations where new machine type can be defined in the config file and initiated accordingly .
